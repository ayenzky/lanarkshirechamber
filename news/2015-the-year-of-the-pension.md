The terms "excitement" and "pensions" rarely converge, but this is an exciting year in the pensions world.
The Chancellor announced last year that, from April 2015, savers will have more choice in retirement thanks to dramatic changes to pension rules.
In retirement, you will no longer be forced to take out an annuity that offers little value for money to provide an income.
Instead, once retired, you will be able to access your pension pot anytime you like. The first 25% of all withdrawals will be tax-free and the remainder taxed as income.
This is also a massive year for Auto Enrolment with more than 150,000 companies staging over the next year.
Preparing early will mean you can have your pension scheme in place and be ready for auto enrolment when the time comes for you to stage.
There is a serious need to promote a savings culture in the UK.
Households must become less dependent on the state to provide for them in retirement and start making their own provisions in order to maintain the same quality of life.
2015 will take a big step in the right direction with more people automatically enrolled into pension schemes and positive changes to the way you can take your pension in retirement.
